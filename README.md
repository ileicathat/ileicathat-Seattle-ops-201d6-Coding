Welcome to my **Ops201d6** Class Repository

      Here we will find sample code or notes, some good and those needing revision. It will be a window into my journey in CyberSecurity as well as a little bit of Coding / Scripting. I hope that as a viewer you may find something of interest or value that could help you in your studies. I also encourage you to reach out to me if you see something that may assist in my notes or coding, or even just to offer information that may be beneficial as well. 
        Good luck on your own research and I hope we can help each other someday!

Welcome to my **Ops201d6** Class Repository

      Here we will find sample code or notes, some good and those needing revision. It will be a window into my journey in CyberSecurity as well as a little bit of Coding / Scripting. I hope that as a viewer you may find something of interest or value that could help you in your studies. I also encourage you to reach out to me if you see something that may assist in my notes or coding, or even just to offer information that may be beneficial as well. 
      I started this journey as a long over due continuation of an interest in computers back in college days when I was studying computer science and working as a network technician. These skills, updated and applied to today's needs in cybersecurity will be the best combination of income generating potential, job portability and infinitely interesting challenges to work on.
       While going through the Codefellows Ops 201 program, I learned to think more simply like a computer would when it comes to coding and scripting. Taking things slowly, and line by line was a good system to help debug my code when I would have errors. I also learned that you really can find pretty much any technical answer you need by using the very technology you're learning about, the internet with world wide access. Much of the teaching and learning takes place by utilizing your ability to phrase questions about what you want to know and how to ask about it online to generate valid answers to questions.
       One of the most interesting Ops Challenges whas the sections around powershell. It was amazing to see how powerful command line scripting can be on windows and its ability to manipulate settings remotely. I was not very good at it but plan on getting much better with this useful tool.
       Shell scripting can be used to turn on and off firewalls, setting user access permissions, sort and refine large data files or automating important things like backups. All are useful options to be able to do in a work setting.
       I really need to spend more time on my loops and boolean logic applied to it. Too often I would get lost in even simple code beause of nested loops and not remembering to close one of them or forgetting a small syntax related character. 
       I would like to learn more about bash scripting to help automate Linux related tasks as I learn more about that operating system. Because it can be primarilly command line based, I can see how repetative tasks would get cumbersome to write out whole commands over and over again, when a little time spent on a useful set of actions in a script will save a lot of headache.
       
       
        Good luck on your own research and I hope we can help each other someday!
